# DeviceHub

DeviceHub is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing Linux devices
via command line (using any SSH client) or web-based user interface.
It is intended to be used instead of sshd. DeviceHub enables teams to
easily access any Linux device behind firewall and NAT.

## Development

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compse up
```
